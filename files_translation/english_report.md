#### Land Degradation in Assaba and the Sahel: Drivers, Impacts, and Solutions

#### Scope
This report investigates the causes and effects of land degradation in the Assaba region of Mauritania and similar Sahelian zones over the past two decades, and evaluates innovative solutions and initiatives for sustainable land management. It covers climatic factors (e.g. recurrent droughts, rainfall variability, rising temperatures), anthropogenic drivers (population growth, overgrazing, deforestation, unsustainable farming, urban sprawl), and socio-economic issues (poverty, resource conflicts, land tenure insecurity). The report also identifies spatial “hotspots” of land cover change using Earth observation data, and reviews restoration strategies and global initiatives such as the Great Green Wall and the G20’s Global Land Restoration Initiative.

#### Key Findings
Sahelian land degradation is driven by a combination of harsher climate and human pressures. Climatic stresses include more erratic rainfall and frequent droughts that reduce vegetation cover and water availability. Demographic and land-use pressures are intense: the Sahel’s population grew ~3% annually (doubling roughly every 23 years) with urban populations rising ~5% yearly, leading to expanded agriculture and grazing into marginal lands. In Mauritania’s Assaba region, virtually all natural forest has disappeared (<0.1% forest cover), due to decades of fuelwood cutting and farmland clearing. Overgrazing by ever-larger herds around villages has stripped vegetation, while unsustainable farming practices and bushfires have further degraded soil fertility. Socio-economic challenges like rural poverty and unclear land rights exacerbate these trends, often fueling farmer-herder conflicts over the shrinking productive land.

#### Impacts
Land degradation is undermining ecological and human well-being. Ecologically, it fragments habitats and causes loss of plant and animal species, reducing biodiversity. Agricultural productivity suffers as soils erode and nutrients deplete – degraded Sahelian soils produce significantly lower crop yields, worsening food insecurity. For example, Mauritania’s deteriorating land and water resources have contributed to chronically weak cereal yields and pasture shortages. Water scarcity is amplified since denuded land retains less rainfall; groundwater recharge declines even as flash floods and siltation increase. Socially and economically, degraded land means livelihoods (farming and herding) are more vulnerable. In Mauritania, droughts and land overuse have led to recurrent food crises, with over a quarter of the population affected by food insecurity. Women and pastoral groups are especially hard-hit, and resource scarcity has triggered local conflicts and migration. The cumulative effect is a poverty trap where land degradation and socio-economic hardships reinforce one another.

#### Spatial Hotspots
Satellite observations over the last 20 years show a patchwork of “greening” and “browning” across the Sahel. Areas with increasing rainfall have seen a rebound in vegetation (notably parts of West Africa), whereas pockets of significant vegetation decline (~5.3% of the Sudano-Sahel) exist in zones of high human pressure or persistent drought. In Assaba and neighboring regions along the Sahara fringe, ground data and imagery reveal extensive loss of natural vegetation and topsoil. Around expanding towns, land cover change is evident – urban sprawl and infrastructure have consumed nearby arable land and woodlands, while demand for charcoal and water in cities has intensified resource extraction in peri-urban areas. These localized hotspots of land use change contribute disproportionately to regional degradation. Mapping of land productivity indicates that heavily farmed areas and overgrazed rangelands (for example, along seasonal rivers or around wells) have experienced the sharpest declines in vegetation cover, whereas some remote or well-managed community lands show stable or recovering vegetation.

#### Solutions and Initiatives
Despite the challenges, numerous sustainable land management (SLM) strategies and initiatives are offering hope. Traditional practices enhanced with modern knowledge are reversing degradation on many sites:

#### Agroforestry and Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR)
Integrating trees back into farmlands has proven to restore soil and productivity. FMNR, which encourages regrowth of native tree stumps on crop fields, has re-greened about 5 million hectares of formerly barren cropland in Niger, boosting grain yields by ~30% and farmer incomes. This low-cost approach now produces an extra 500,000 tons of cereals per year and has improved food security for millions. Empowering farmers with tree ownership rights (as Niger did in 2020 by decree) greatly accelerated FMNR uptake. Agroforestry systems (such as interplanting drought-resistant Faidherbia albida trees in fields) improve soil moisture and fertility, which in turn increases crop yields and fodder availability while sequestering carbon.

#### Soil and Water Conservation Measures
Simple water-harvesting techniques are revitalizing degraded soils. For instance, zaï pits – small dug pits filled with compost – capture rainwater and concentrate nutrients for crops. In Burkina Faso’s Yatenga region, farmers using zaï micro-catchments have tripled their millet and sorghum yields (≈1,500 kg/ha with zaï vs <500 kg/ha normally). Zaï pits also trap wind-blown seeds and organic matter, inadvertently aiding natural tree regeneration on fields. Other measures like stone contour bunds, half-moon catchments, and hillside terracing are widely used to reduce runoff and soil erosion. These techniques have restored fertility to tens of thousands of hectares of Sahelian land that was once considered “lost” to hardpan and crust. Community-led watershed management projects in Mali and Niger show that combining such physical structures with reforestation of slopes can rehabilitate dry streambeds and recharge groundwater.

#### Drought-Tolerant Crops and Climate-Smart Farming
Agricultural research has delivered improved crop varieties that withstand Sahel’s climate stresses. For example, new drought-tolerant maize hybrids yield 20–35% more grain under dry conditions than conventional seeds, and traditional hardy crops like millet, sorghum, cowpea, and fonio are being rediscovered and improved for resilience. Climate-smart techniques such as intercropping cereals with legumes, using mulches, and “micro-dosing” small quantities of fertilizer at planting have significantly raised farm productivity on marginal soils while preserving soil health. In parallel, programs promoting climate-resilient livestock breeds and controlled grazing (rotational grazing zones, cut-and-carry feeding, etc.) are helping pastoralists cope with fodder shortages and reduce pressure on overgrazed rangelands.

#### Community-Based Restoration and Indigenous Knowledge
Successful projects consistently involve local communities at every stage. In Assaba and other Mauritanian wilayas, community associations have led initiatives to stabilize sand dunes, replant oases, and create “village forests” for fuelwood. Fencing degraded plots to exclude livestock for a recovery period has shown striking results – within a few years, vegetation cover and soil organic matter improve noticeably. Communities report better pasture and crop yields after such regeneration, confirming the value of traditional practices like seasonal grazing reserves. Indigenous knowledge is being integrated with modern science: farmers’ time-tested methods (e.g. timing planting with certain environmental cues, using particular plant species to rehabilitate soil) complement external expertise. Notably, the revival of the zaï technique in Burkina Faso by innovator Yacouba Sawadogo (dubbed “the man who stopped the desert”) demonstrated how local knowledge can scale up – he and his village rehabilitated 27 hectares of degraded land, inspiring wider adoption and earning UN recognition. Such examples underscore that social innovation – from land-tenure reforms to participatory education – is as crucial as technical innovation. Where farmers and herders organize themselves in managing resources (for example, community grazing schedules or collective woodlots), lands tend to degrade less and recover faster.

#### Technological Innovations
Modern technology is enhancing monitoring and implementation of SLM. Satellite-based remote sensing and GIS dashboards now allow stakeholders to visualize land cover changes almost in real time. Governments and NGOs use tools like NASA’s NDVI data and the Trends.Earth platform to identify degradation hotspots and track restoration progress via dashboards that show vegetation indices, ground cover, and soil moisture. This data-driven approach aids in targeting interventions and mobilizing support by clearly illustrating where land health is declining or improving. On the ground, emerging precision agriculture methods – though in early stages in the Sahel – offer promise: solar-powered drip irrigation, mobile apps delivering weather forecasts and planting advice, and even drone-assisted tree planting are being piloted to optimize resource use. In Niger and Senegal, for example, farmers receive SMS alerts on impending dryspells so they can adjust sowing dates or practice water-saving measures. These technologies, coupled with training, help communities make informed decisions and maximize the gains from traditional practices. Importantly, many of these innovations are low-cost and adapted to local contexts (e.g. using simple SMS instead of requiring internet), making them scalable even in remote, low-resource settings.

#### Global and Regional Initiatives
Land restoration in the Sahel has strong international backing. The Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative, of which Mauritania’s Assaba is a part, aims to restore 100 million hectares across the Sahel by 2030 through a mosaic of greening projects. While initial progress was slow, recent efforts have accelerated – communities have planted drought-resistant trees, built water-spreading dikes, and adopted FMNR along thousands of kilometers in the GGW corridor. Donor pledges (over USD 14 billion) at the 2021 One Planet Summit have reinvigorated the GGW, aligning it with climate adaptation and job-creation goals. Mauritania has embraced these efforts, setting a voluntary target to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) by 2030. This means every hectare of land degraded would be offset by a hectare restored. Achieving LDN involves policy integration – for instance, Mauritania’s government is working to mainstream sustainable land management into its national poverty reduction and food security strategies. At the global level, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) is galvanizing support and knowledge exchange for such projects, and the G20’s Global Land Restoration Initiative (launched under Saudi Arabia’s G20 presidency) is providing a platform to coordinate large-scale restoration investments. These initiatives stress not only tree-planting but also rehabilitation of soil, water, and livelihoods – a holistic approach.

#### Implementation and Scalability
Case studies from Assaba and similar regions highlight both the potential and challenges of scaling up these solutions. In Mauritania’s Assaba, a sustainable land management project supported by the World Bank piloted community-driven micro-projects (tree planting, pasture reseeding, dune fixation) in dozens of villages. The outcomes were positive – 1,100 hectares of degraded land were restored, showing reappearance of native grasses and higher fodder production. Notably, all 189 community sub-projects were transparently managed with no reported misuse of funds, indicating strong local buy-in. This suggests that with the right facilitation, communities can scale out these interventions themselves. The project’s success factors included participatory planning, capacity-building (training locals in nursery and soil/water conservation techniques), and peer exchange visits – farmers from different villages learned from each other’s successes, spurring adoption of best practices. Such approaches are replicable across the Sahel, as they rely on empowering local actors rather than expensive external inputs.

#### Recommendations
To sustain and scale land restoration in Assaba and across the Sahel, a multi-pronged strategy is recommended:

- **Strengthen Climate Resilience**: Integrate land restoration with climate adaptation plans, expand drought early-warning systems, and support diversified livelihoods.
- **Policy and Land Tenure Reforms**: Create an enabling framework for SLM by securing local communities’ rights to manage and benefit from trees, forests, and rangelands.
- **Community Engagement and Capacity Building**: Shift from top-down to community-led restoration efforts, building local capacity through training and knowledge-sharing.
- **Scale Up Successful Practices with Innovation**: Replicate successful models like FMNR and water-harvesting techniques, combining them with modern technology where feasible.
- **Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration**: Foster coordination among governments, NGOs, researchers, and the private sector to scale up restoration efforts.
- **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adaptive Management**: Implement systems to track progress and adapt strategies based on feedback from the field.

In conclusion, the Assaba region and the wider Sahel face a formidable challenge from land degradation driven by climate change and human demands. However, this research highlights that land degradation is not irreversible. With the right combination of local action, modern innovation, and global support, the Sahel can overcome its challenges and move towards a greener, more resilient future.
